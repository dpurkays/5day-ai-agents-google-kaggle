| 1   | [Introduction to Agents](./day1-intro-agents/)                                              | Overview of agent taxonomies, the Agent Ops discipline, and building your first agent system                                  |
| 2   | [Agent Tools & Interoperability with Model Context Protocol (MCP)](./day2-agent-tools-mcp/) | How agents call external tools, custom tool design, and long-running operations using MCP                                     |
| 3   | [Context Engineering: Sessions & Memory](./day3-sessions-memory/)                           | Building stateful agents, working with session/history, and persistent memory across interactions                             |
| 4   | [Agent Quality](./day4-agent-quality/)                                                      | Observability and evaluation with logs, traces, metrics, LLM-as-a-Judge, and human-in-the-loop methods                        |
| 5   | [Prototype to Production](./day5-prototype-production/)                                     | Transitioning agents from prototype to scalable systems, communication between agents (A2A protocol) and deployment pathways. |

## 🚀 Key Skills & Learnings

- Built agent systems capable of multi-step reasoning, tool invocation, and action/observation loops.
- Designed tool-using agents by integrating Python functions, built-in tools, and the MCP protocol.
- Engineered context and memory mechanics for coherent multi-turn conversations.
- Implemented evaluation frameworks measuring agent behavior, tool usage and response quality.
- Explored multi-agent workflows using the A2A protocol and deployment considerations for production readiness.

## 🔭 Next Steps

I am now embarking on a **capstone project** to apply the skills and concepts learned in this program.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

Thank you to the teams at Kaggle and Google for delivering a well-structured, immersive learning experience.

Special thanks to the whitepaper authors for clear explanations, the codelab authors for helping me apply my learning, the NotebookLM summaries, the daily YouTube live sessions, the supportive Discord community, and everyone who worked behind the scenes to make this course possible.

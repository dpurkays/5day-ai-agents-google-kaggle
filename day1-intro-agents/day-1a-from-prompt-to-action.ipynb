You've just seen the core concept of agent development in action.\n\nThe big takeaway is that your agent didn't just *respond*—it **reasoned** that it needed more information and then **acted** by using a tool. This ability to take action is the foundation of all agent-based AI.\n\n**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n\nThis notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.

Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n\nJust like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n\n## ‼️ Please Read\n\n> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.

However, they also bring a heightened focus on AI governance, ethics, and security.\nAggregatorAgent > **Executive Briefing: AI Dominates Tech, Health, and Finance Advancements**\n\nArtificial Intelligence is the unifying force driving innovation across all three sectors. Generative AI is rapidly integrating into enterprise workflows, enhancing productivity and creativity, while agentic AI is paving the way for autonomous systems and task automation. The development of domain-specific AI models for healthcare and finance promises increased accuracy and tailored solutions.\n\nIn **Health**, AI is revolutionizing early disease detection and personalized medicine, complementing breakthroughs like mRNA vaccine applications beyond infectious diseases and novel pediatric cardiac treatments. However, public health challenges, such as the re-emergence of measles, highlight the persistent need for robust vaccination efforts.\n\n**Finance** is experiencing transformation through embedded finance and maturing Decentralized Finance (DeFi) solutions, both leveraging AI for personalization and efficiency. Discussions around sustainable finance and financial inclusion are gaining prominence, alongside the strategic importance of AI chips and the growing concerns regarding AI's potential harms and the need for robust governance.\n\nOverall, these interconnected trends signal accelerated digital transformation, with significant market growth projected in the next 1-5 years, underscoring the critical need for ethical considerations and security in AI development.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":21},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"🎉 Great! You've seen how parallel agents can dramatically speed up workflows by running independent tasks concurrently.\n\nSo far, all our workflows run from start to finish and then stop. **But what if you need to review and improve an output multiple times?** Next, we'll build a workflow that can loop and refine its own work.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n## ➰ Section 5: Loop Workflows - The Refinement Cycle\n\n**The Problem: One-Shot Quality**\n\nAll the workflows we've seen so far run from start to finish. The `SequentialAgent` and `ParallelAgent` produce their final output and then stop. This 'one-shot' approach isn't good for tasks that require refinement and quality control. What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n\nWhen a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`. A `LoopAgent` runs a set of sub-agents repeatedly *until a specific condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.* This creates a refinement cycle, allowing the agent system to improve its own work over and over.\n\n**Use Loop when:** Iterative improvement is needed, quality refinement matters, or you need repeated cycles.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [loop agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Story Writing & Critique Loop**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"Initial Prompt\"] -- > B[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    B -- >|story| C[\"Critic Agent\"]\n    C -- >|critique| D{\"Iteration < Max<br>AND<br>Not Approved?\"}\n    D -- >|Yes| B\n    D -- >|No| E[\"Final Story\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style C fill:#ffcccc\n    style D fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"250\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/loop-agent.png\" alt=\"Loop Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5.1 Example: Iterative Story Refinement\n\nLet's build a system with two agents:\n\n1. **Writer Agent** - Writes a draft of a short story\n2. **Critic Agent** - Reviews and critiques the short story to suggest improvements","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent runs ONCE at the beginning to create the first draft.\ninitial_writer_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"InitialWriterAgent\",\n    model=Gemini(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n        retry_options=retry_config\n    ),\n    instruction=\"\"\"Based on the user's prompt, write the first draft of a short story (around 100-150 words).\n    Output only the story text, with no introduction or explanation.\"\"\",\n    output_key=\"current_story\",  # Stores the first draft in the state.\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\")","metadata":{"id":"a2b8WlJoBtHF","outputId":"13ed1e15-dcf9-4e1d-ad1e-fb18ee793de5","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-11T03:29:39.472605Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-11T03:29:39.472921Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-11T03:29:39.478747Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-11T03:29:39.472900Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-11T03:29:39.477731Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":22},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent's only job is to provide feedback or the approval signal.

It was of the void.\nCriticAgent > This is a promising start, with a strong sense of atmosphere and a compelling mystery. Here are a few suggestions to enhance it:\n\n1.  **Deepen Elias's Character and Motivation:** While Elias is established as a \"keeper of the lonely sentinel,\" we don't yet know much about his inner world or what drives him. Before he finds the map, consider adding a brief moment that reveals his feelings about his solitary life. Is he content, resigned, or perhaps yearning for something more? This would make his \"inexplicable yearning\" upon seeing the map more impactful and relatable. For example, you could show him looking out at the vast sea with a sigh, or perhaps he keeps a worn photograph of a loved one, hinting at a past he misses.\n\n2.  **Enhance the Discovery Scene:** The discovery of the map is intriguing, but the \"faintly luminescent\" quality could be amplified to create a stronger sense of the uncanny. Instead of just noticing it, perhaps Elias is drawn to a subtle glow emanating from the storeroom, or the parchment itself seems to hum with a soft light that catches his eye even in the dimness. This would heighten the magical or otherworldly nature of the find.\n\n3.  **Expand on the Map's Visuals and Elias's Reaction:** The description of the map is good, but further sensory details could make it even more vivid. What *kind* of shimmering lines? Are they like liquid light, or delicate threads? What are the colors of the nebulae? Elias's reaction, \"a sudden, inexplicable yearning,\" is excellent. You could build on this by describing a physical sensation associated with it – a tightening in his chest, a breath catching in his throat, or a sudden feeling of warmth spreading through him. This would make his emotional response more visceral for the reader.\nRefinerAgent > Elias, the keeper of the lonely sentinel, polished the great lens, his movements slow and deliberate. The wind howled, a familiar lullaby against the ancient stone, a sound that had underscored his solitary existence for years. Tonight, however, the sea was unusually calm, the stars sharp as broken glass against the inky canvas. Elias sighed, a quiet sound lost in the wind's embrace. He often found himself gazing at the endless expanse, a flicker of something – a quiet resignation, perhaps, or a deep-seated longing for a life beyond these isolated shores – stirring within him. He’d gone down to the storeroom for extra oil, the air thick with the scent of brine and aged wood, when a peculiar, soft glow caught his eye. It seemed to emanate from beneath a coil of thick rope, a faint, ethereal luminescence that drew him closer. Tucked away was a rolled parchment, pulsing with a gentle, otherworldly light.\n\nHe unfurled it carefully, his breath catching in his throat. It was a map, unlike any he’d ever conceived. No familiar coastlines marred its surface, no guiding compass rose offered direction. Instead, delicate threads of shimmering, liquid light pulsed with an inner radiance, depicting swirling nebulae in hues of amethyst and emerald, and constellations utterly alien to Earth’s sky. At its heart, a single, radiant star pulsed with a potent, beckoning glow. Elias traced its light, a sudden, inexplicable yearning tightening in his chest, a warmth spreading through him as if he’d finally found a place he belonged. The map wasn't of any sea he knew, he realized with dawning wonder.

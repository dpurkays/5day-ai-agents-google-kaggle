In the context of drug discovery, this means AI models can learn the \"rules\" of chemistry and biology from vast datasets of existing molecules and their properties, and then use that knowledge to **generate entirely new molecular structures.**\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n*   **Traditional Drug Discovery (Screening):** Imagine searching for a specific key in a massive warehouse filled with millions of existing keys. You have to pick them up one by one and try them in the lock.\n*   **Generative AI for Drug Discovery:** Imagine an AI that has seen thousands of keys and understands what makes a good key. You tell it, \"I need a key that opens this specific lock and is also small and made of a certain material.\" The AI can then design and propose a *brand new key* that perfectly fits your criteria, rather than just sifting through what already exists.\n\n**Key Concepts and Techniques Used:**\n\n*   **Deep Learning Models:** Primarily, advanced neural network architectures are employed.\n*   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** These involve two neural networks – a \"generator\" that creates new molecules and a \"discriminator\" that tries to distinguish real molecules from the generated ones. They train each other, leading to increasingly realistic and effective generated molecules.\n*   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** These models learn a compressed representation (latent space) of molecules and can then decode this representation to generate new molecules.\n*   **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** RL can be used to guide the generation process by rewarding the AI for creating molecules with desired properties.\n*   **Transformer Models:** Originally developed for natural language processing, these are also being adapted for molecule generation, treating molecular sequences like words.\n\n**How it Works in Practice:**\n\n1.  **Training Data:** The AI is trained on massive datasets of known molecules, their chemical structures, and their associated properties (e.g., binding affinity to a protein target, solubility, toxicity data, pharmacokinetic parameters).\n2.  **Defining the Goal:** Researchers specify the desired characteristics for the new molecule. This could include:\n    *   **Target Binding Affinity:** How strongly it binds to a specific disease-related protein.\n    *   **Selectivity:** How well it binds to the target without binding to other unintended proteins.\n    *   **ADMET Properties:** Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity – crucial for a drug to be safe and effective in the body.\n    *   **Synthesizability:** How easy it is to actually create the molecule in a lab.\n3.  **Generation:** The generative AI model then proposes novel molecular structures that are predicted to meet these criteria.\n4.  **Filtering and Optimization:** The generated molecules are further filtered and optimized using both AI and traditional computational methods.\n5.  **Experimental Validation:** The most promising candidates are then synthesized and tested experimentally in the lab.\n\n**Why is this a Game-Changer?**\n\n*   **Vastly Expanded Chemical Space:** It moves beyond the limitations of screening existing libraries, exploring molecules that might never have been conceived by human chemists.\n*   **De Novo Design:** It allows for the creation of entirely novel chemical entities, potentially leading to breakthrough therapies.\n*   **Tailored Molecules:** It enables the design of molecules specifically optimized for a particular target and desired properties, rather than making compromises with existing structures.\n*   **Accelerated Discovery:** By rapidly generating and filtering potential candidates, it significantly speeds up the early stages of drug discovery.\n*   **Addressing Undruggable Targets:** It opens up possibilities for designing molecules against targets that have been difficult to drug with traditional methods.\n\nThis development is not just about finding *a* drug; it's about **designing the *best possible* drug** from the ground up, based on a deep understanding of molecular interactions and desired outcomes. It represents a shift from searching to creating in drug discovery.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies leveraging generative AI for novel molecule design is dynamic and rapidly growing.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
